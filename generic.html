								<h2>Personal story</h2>
								<p>My name is Austin Fenne and I am a software engineer with a passion for creating applications and software. I was born in Minnesota and after high school, I attended a local community college where I took my first programming class in Java. I was immediately fascinated with the potential to create anything I wanted using code and I began working on projects such as a video game bot to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
								<p>I realized that coding was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life, but I struggled with how to afford the expenses of university. As a solution, I joined the military and served for 7 years as an IT support specialist. In this role, I assisted with setting up internet and communication systems in remote locations, as well as managing a team of IT support soldiers. While serving, I also took classes at the University of Minnesota and majored in software engineering. I did end up leaving university in good academic standing</p>
								<p>In college, I started a programming club and participated in a coding competition at a company called DigiKey, where we placed in the top 10 among all the colleges that attended. Despite my successes in college, I still felt like I didn't have enough knowledge to land an entry-level software engineering position.</p>
<p>To further hone my skills in software engineering, I decided to attend App Academy, where I gained hands-on experience and in-depth knowledge of technologies such as Javascript, React, Express, Flask, Python, Git, SQLAlchemy, Sequelize, Docker, HTML, CSS, and SQL.</p>
								<p>In my professional career, I have gained experience as a software engineer intern at Zuora, where I worked on backend features using Spring Boot and Java, I converted a tightly coupled component in a monolithic application into its own separate microservice, and collaborated with senior software engineers to improve code designs.</p>

								<p>I have also completed a variety of projects, including:
<ul>
<li>A Slack clone, which demonstrates my skills in technologies such as React, Javascript, Redux, Flask, Python, PostgresSQL, SqlAlchemy, and SocketIO. In this project, I implemented socketIO rooms to allow for real-time instant messaging between users, integrated Redux to correctly display logged in users channels, conversations, and workspaces, and leveraged React context to create UI modals for login, signup, editing channels, and editing workspaces.</li>

<li>A Medium clone, which showcases my experience with technologies such as React, Javascript, Redux, Flask, Python, SqlAlchemy, and PostgresSQL. In this project, I utilized Redux and React to allow users to like a post and comment on post, integrated an open-source text editor, proseMirror, for a better user experience when creating a story, and implemented a backend using Flask and Python to save and retrieve stories from a PostgresSQL database.</li></ul></p>
						<p>Overall, I am a detail-oriented software engineer with experience in diverse and specialized environments. I have excellent listening, conflict resolution, and communication skills and I am seeking to take the next step in my career with a respected organization that is dedicated to world-class quality.</p>
